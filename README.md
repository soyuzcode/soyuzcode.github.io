# SoyuzCode F1 Tracks Visualizer

This project is part of a competition organized by TBox about Formula 1. Its main goal is to provide an interactive visualization of F1 circuits in 3D using an iFrame.

## Features

- 3D visualization of F1 tracks.
- Clients receive an embedded iFrame to explore the circuits.
- The embed code is automatically obtained from another repository by the same user.

## Usage

You can use the visualizer by visiting:

`https://soyuzcode.github.io/?value=[TRACK]`

Replace `[TRACK]` with one of the nine available tracks.

## Related Repository

This project uses the embed code from another [repository](https://github.com/soyuzcode/f1_race_models) to display the 3D models.
